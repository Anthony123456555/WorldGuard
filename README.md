This plugin is a port of the popular bukkit plugin called ["WorldGuard"](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard). It was originally developed by [Muqsit](https://github.com/Muqsit), but more flags and extended capabilities were added by me.

# Features
- Easily define regions in your world.
- Add custom flags on defined regions that allow/restrict certain actions and events.
- Delete/Modify already defined regions.

# Utility
- Defined regions can be used to protect specific areas of your world from griefing, pvp, damaging mobs, building, and some other events.  
For the full list of flags check the tutorial below.

# Tutorial
Read the [tutorial](https://github.com/Chalapa13/WorldGuard/wiki/Tutorial).  

For the added flags check [here](https://github.com/Chalapa13/WorldGuard).  
Be sure to check the above link when updating the plugin to see changes and view available flags. (can also be found in-game by doing /rg flags get region_name)

# Dev builds
For more frequent updates (risk of bugs) you can download the plugin from [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Chalapa13/WorldGuard/WorldGuard).

# Customizable Permissions
Some flags come with their own permission in order to customize regions even more and only allow certain groups of players do certain actions in a region.
